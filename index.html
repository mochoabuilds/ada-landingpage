            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>As Earth’s cities become filled with smog and traffic jams new solutions must surface to solve our global transit challenge.  Existing infrastructure cannot support another generation of gas guzzling vehicles.  The lost time, wasted fuel and climbing costs of doing business are not sustainable.  We must begin chipping away at this collective problem. Our mission is to be deploy Chicago's most hospitable, accessible and carbon neutral riverway transit. </p>

            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>The story begins in 2018 along the Chicago riverwalk. As I considered graduate school and the riverway was a frequent spot for my preparatory coursework.  By some accounts, the sounds of the river struck me first.  I grew interested in the sounds made as the wake splashed the riverwalk. Soon after, half formed ideas began to coalesce.  Working from my apartment, I built a prototype scale model water robotaxi that travels from the Chicago Riverwalk to Goose Island without human intervention.

            <h2>How will we do it?</h2>
            <p>We deploy a hybrid system made of up of a robotaxi and human safety driver to chip away at the problem.  The system blends the rational analytics of a computer integrating inertial, optical and thermal data with human strategic guidance.  We believe in letting machines do what they do best (lane keeping, active cruise control, trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance) and letting humans do what we do best (be the social and hospitable animals that we are).  Our narrow focus on blending L2+ level autonomy with hospitality means our transit does more provide convenience, it’s a space that prepares you to take on the city — a kind of home-away-from-home on the river.
