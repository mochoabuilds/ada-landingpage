            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>As Earth’s cities become filled with smog and traffic jams new solutions must surface to solve our global transit challenge. Existing infrastructure cannot support another generation of gas guzzling vehicles. The number of hours we’ve lost to traffic delay, the costs of gridlock and fuel wasted in stalled traffic are not sustainable. We must begin chipping away at this global problem.  Our mission is to be deploy Chicago's most hospitable, accessible and carbon neutral riverway transit. </p>

            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>The story begins in 2018 along the Chicago riverwalk.  As I considered graduate school the riverway was a frequent spot for self study of preparatory coursework.  Soon after, half formed ideas began to coalesce around my self study.  Working from my apartment, I building a scale model water robotaxi that travels from the Chicago Riverwalk to Goose Island without human intervention. </p>

            <h2>How will we do it?</h2>
            <p> The paper presents the body design, hardware and software processing pipeline for an L2+ level autonomous system. Our proof of concept is easy to manufacture, less than $$$$ and capable of: lane keeping, active cruise control, trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance in open water environments. We run field tests to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed thruster strategy, which is essential for accomplishing more advanced autonomy tasks. Our goal is to create an experience piloted by hybrid system that is so comfortable that it could impress a safety commissioner.
