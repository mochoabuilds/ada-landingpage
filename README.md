## Motivation

Global sea level rise will be among one of many challenges facing our society this century. Understanding how this phenomenon will reverberate onto these communities will require a regular presence. The goal of our autonomous boats is to be that regular resilient waterway presence for communities.

## History

Our story begins in the summer of 2018. Combing thru preparatory coursework for graduate school the river was a frequent spot for self-study. Eventually some half formed ideas began to coalesce watching boats pass by. Working from my apartment, I began conceptualizing the hull design, sensor kit and technology stack for a scale model autonomous boat specialized for Chicago's riverways.
